# jekyll-postfiles is lovely, *but* it doesn't handle front matter â€“ which is
# reasonable, I suppose, since asset path front matter properties
# don't have set keys. This little band-aid makes it possible for front matter
# asset paths to work the same way jekyll-postfiles does.

# Could be put in _config.yaml, but I don't see the need at the moment.
