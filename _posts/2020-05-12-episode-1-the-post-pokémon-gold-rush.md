On this inaugural episode of Obscuriosities, we talk about mon games – games inspired to ride the coattails of Pokémon's creature-collecting craze. But of course, unlike a Digimon or a Monster Rancher… these games didn't make it big.

Today, we explore *Kotobattle: Tengai no Moribito* (Game Boy Color), *Kanzume Monsters* (Game Boy), *Kanzume Monsters: Parfait* (Game Boy Color), *Kaseki Sōsei Reborn* (Game Boy), and *Kaseki Sōsei Reborn II: Monster Digger* (Game Boy Color).

Could that be a turtle?
![Screenshot of Reborn]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/episodes/episode-1-the-post-pok%C3%A9mon-gold-rush/images/reborn/5.png)
No! It's a UNICORN SEA OTTER!

"Tomate attacks. Palm slap!"
![Screenshot of Reborn]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/episodes/episode-1-the-post-pok%C3%A9mon-gold-rush/images/reborn/7.png)
The dungeon map uses sub-tile graphics – each square is 4×4 instead of 8×8 – which is quite rare on Game Boy!
![Screenshot of Reborn]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/episodes/episode-1-the-post-pok%C3%A9mon-gold-rush/images/reborn/8.png)
"Crawls along the ground and is hard to spot. Usually timid, but is fearsome when angered. Its legs double as fins."
![Screenshot of Reborn]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/episodes/episode-1-the-post-pok%C3%A9mon-gold-rush/images/reborn/9.png)
Surrounded by three enemies who all do battle with you simultaneously – a bad situation to be in.

The character designs in Reborn II are a bit more kids' show-like; a bit more "out there" in comparison to the sober faces of the original.
